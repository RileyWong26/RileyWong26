- 👋 Hi, I’m Riley Wong,
  
  a first year computer science student at Western University.  I have been programming for about 3 years, and done various projects in **java,** **python,** **javascript** and html css.
  I love to work on all sorts of different projects, and love expanding my knowledge.  I am also interested in game developpement!

- 📍 My favourite project, was an application that helped students study.  It was made with a friend where users could create study sets, where terms were inputted and linked to definitions or answers.
  Then tools, such as tests, and flashcards could be used.  We worked with **GUIS** and **File io**.
- 👀 I’m interested in making all sorts of applications!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **backend** or **games** or anything inbetween!
