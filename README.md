- 👋 Hi, I’m Riley Wong,
  
  a first year computer science student at Western University.  I have been programming for about 3 years, and done various projects in **java,** **python,** **javascript** and html css.
  I love to work on all sorts of different projects, and love expanding my knowledge.  I am also interested in game developpement!

- 📍 My favourite project, was creating a deep learning model for London called the LTC big data project.  Where a deep learning model was made to accurately predict the delay on bus arrival times.  It is my favorite project, as it taught me a lot about machine learning, and allowed me to both impact the community and be able to see the impact I caused.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about **machine learning** and **AI**, and learning more frameworks and languages!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning and AI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **machine learning** projects!
